We were looking at an issue that was just a quick text change on the frontend, and the thought process was, &amp;ldquo;Why do I have to create a new branch, a draft merge request, commit, and then un-draft it just for this tiny thing?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>From Specialist to Swiss Army Knife: The Value of Flexible Developers</title><link>https://frikyfriky11.github.io/posts/from-specialist-to-swiss-army-knife-the-value-of-flexible-developers/</link><pubDate>Fri, 22 Aug 2025 06:47:17 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://frikyfriky11.github.io/posts/from-specialist-to-swiss-army-knife-the-value-of-flexible-developers/</guid><description>&lt;p>Being a specialist is a fantastic thing. In the world of software development, where roles like frontend, backend, or DevOps are well-defined, becoming an expert in one area brings immense value to a company. You&amp;rsquo;re the go-to person, the master of your craft, and your deep knowledge allows you to build incredibly robust and efficient solutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the reality for many of us, myself included, is that being a specialist isn&amp;rsquo;t always enough. I&amp;rsquo;ve often found myself in situations where a small task falls outside my usual scopeâ€”maybe a quick change on the frontend for a backend developer, or a database tweak for a frontend expert. In these moments, I believe a developer shouldn&amp;rsquo;t just say, &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s not my job.&amp;rdquo; Instead, with some curiosity and a bit of good old-fashioned Googling, we should be able to tackle the problem and get the job done.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
