Since I was four years old I have been immersed in the world of information technology.

I started my journey by installing my favorite games and destroying several operating systems (sorry Windows 98, it wasn't your fault!), then I moved on to discover the world of the web, HTML (at the time it wasn't HTML5 yet) and a pinch of JavaScript.

My curiosity then extended to the world of hardware but also virtual machines, creating entire distributed networks in VMs on the home PC and fiddling a little too much with the router.

Today I am a full stack senior software engineer (mainly oriented to C#, SQL Server and React/Vue.js), I create and maintain innovative IT solutions in every field, from the world of ERP management to document management, going through extremely specific developments and ad hoc verticalizations studied with the customer.

I follow the development process from the first meeting with the customer to the deployment of the infrastructure, going through analysis, testing and tuning.

I also manage my private cloud infrastructure for a modest customer base, for which I take care of keeping them technologically up to date, always providing cutting-edge and ad hoc solutions.

In the short time I don't have a screen in front of me, I love photographing the world around me and I love listening to metal, rock, pop and house, because I find it reductive to focus on just one genre and one passion.

I discover something new every day and I am never tired of learning, I love to experiment and find solutions to problems that I did not think existed.
